# CSC6304-Advanced-Programming-Concepts
Repository containing the projects for CSC6304 Advanced Programming Concepts course 

# Project 1
Create a demo (using Python and/or any other language) using gRPC to serve solution of quadratic equation and receiving coefficients from a client.
You need to program a server that receiving three Real values (the coefficients a, b, and c) computes the solution of the quadratic equation and returns the string answer to the client;
Create a client file that when run will output the answer to the quadratic equation.  Make sure your application requests the coefficients from the command line.

# Project 2
Create a client API App that asks the user a latitude and a longitude, then gets the values of the parameters office, gridX, and gridY in order to call the
forecast service and describe the forecast for the location of the user input latitude and longitude.
Uses the NOAA National Weather Service API offers the forecast using the web service:
○ https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast

# Project 3
Part 1: Complete the HTML Structure
First, complete the HTML file by adding:
The DOCTYPE declaration
Appropriate meta tags
A proper title
Link to the external CSS file
Add some text to the <body> identifying yourself

Part 2: Implement Three Centering Solutions
You need to implement three different solutions for centering a div both horizontally and vertically within its parent container. Each solution should be visually identical, but use different CSS techniques.

Requirements for Each Solution:
The container div should be 100% of the viewport height
The centered div should be 200px × 200px with a different background color for each solution
Add text that identifies which centering technique is being used
Each solution should be visually separated from the others

# Project 4
Choose a free RESTful API (see some suggestions in the box below) and create a front end HTML/CSS/JS web page that fetches the API information and display in your web page.
The aesthetics is not part of the evaluation, but the mastering of HTML/CSS/JS is.
The end goal here is for you to master the creation of a REST client using HTML/CSS/JS.
Don’t use a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.  Vanilla JS Only!!!

# Project 5
Adapt you Project #2 (Week 3) and the example shown in Week 5 (Weather Front-End HTML/CSS/JS App) to get the user location and deliver, besides other city options the user current location.
Your Project #2 (see Week 3 module) access the National Weather Service API to fetch the office and grid position of a given latitude and longitude;
The example shown last week (Week 5) shows a HTML/CSS/JS front-end app that has the office and grid information of some predefined cities;
Extend the example of Week 5 to include an option "current location" that uses the navigator.geolocation (see this week's slide 21) to get the current latitude and longitude 
and fetch the office and grid position to display the forecast of the current location.

# Project 6
Part A - Pick one of the presented native platforms: Xcode using SwiftUI or Android Studio using Jetpack Compose and create an interactive app.
The app must have at least some form of interaction with the user (a button suffices, but feel free to be creative);
The assignment will be evaluated based on the effectiveness (it should run correctly), not the originality or aesthetics.
Dice Roller App - Android

Part B - Pick one of the presented cross-platforms: Flutter using Dart or React Native using Expo and create an interactive app.
The app must have at least some form of interaction with the user (a button suffices, but feel free to be creative);
The assignment will be evaluated based on the effectiveness (it should run correctly), not the originality or aesthetics.
